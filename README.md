This is the repository for my final project at the iOS Ironhack winter Bootcamp.

It´s called "Zensai" which is the japanese word for "pairing". 
Ever wondered why chilli and chocolate matches? Do they really match? Oysters and Watermelon? 

Zensai is a "discovering app" that displays some kind of flavours ( soil, salty, spice, fruit) with their 
corresponding ingredients and indicates if those selected ingredients match.
